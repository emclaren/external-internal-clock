/*  The External Internal Clock is intended to immerse viewers in a manifestation of stress related to the passage of time throughout the day.
     The experience is meant to be challenging to watch. If you do not wish to look for more than a few seconds, the following are the processes that take place 
     as time progresses:
     -"Thoughts" flash on the screen every 8 seconds, as well as at random (5 frames out of every 100)
     -The nature of "thoughts" change depending on the time of day (defined as morning/afternoon/evening/night)
     -The randomness of the "thoughts" background colour changes depending on the time of day
     -Red "news ticker" style bands of text appear regularly on the top and bottom of screen
     -The upper "news ticker" appears every other minute, reminding viewers that "Time is Precious"
     -The lower "news ticker" appears once every 3 minutes, reminding viewers to "Make every second count" and "Don't be Lazy"
     -For 5 seconds at the end of every minute, viewers are reminded "Don't stop"
     -The passage of time is punctuated by a pulsing Triangle Wave beat (like a second hand on a clock)
     -A sine wave steadily increases as each minute passes
